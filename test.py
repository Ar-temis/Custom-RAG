Topics include pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order execution, caches (memory hierarchies), virtual memory, storage systems, graphics unit, on-chip network. A set of labs would guide students to implement a pipelined processor using HDL and simulation tool flows. COMPSCI 306 recommended.\n\nPrerequisite(s): COMPSCI 205\n\n# COMPSCI 405 Embedded Systems (4 credits)\n\nThe purpose of this course and laboratory is to expose and train the students in modern embedded systems software and hardware design techniques and practices including networking and mobile connectivity. The rationale for the course and lab is based on the explosive growth of embedded systems in the industry, specifically industrial automation, aviation, surveillance, medical devices, and common consumer products. The course topics cover a wide range of material as follows. Microcontroller systems based on the ARM processor. Essential components, memories, busses interfaces. Devices, peripherals, GPIOs, device drivers. Sensors and Actuators, A/D, D/A, DSP. Embedded Linux, kernels, kernel modules, compilers, and assemblers. The Lab will be based on common platforms such as Raspberry PI, Arduino, ARM embed, supported by a network of Linux workstations. PHYS 121 and PHYS 122 are recommended.\n\nPrerequisite(s): COMPSCI 205, COMPSCI 306\n\n# COMPSCI 406 Logic and Formal Methods (4 credits)\n\nTopics include Boolean logic, first-order and second-order logic, resolution, Boolean computation, constraint and satisfiability solving, linear temporal and computation tree logic, model checking.\n\nurl: no url\n\n# Course Code\n\n# Course Name\n\n# Course Credit\n\n|Ethics|PHIL 108|Philosophy and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence|2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| |PHIL 111|Non-Human Animal Ethics|2|\n| |PHIL 206|Climate Change Ethics|2|\n| |ETHLDR 204|Environmental Ethics|4|\n| |ETHLDR 206|Global Justice and Healthcare|4|\n\n# Global Philosophy\n\n|PHIL 103|Chinese and Mediterranean Philosophy|4|\n|---|---|---|\n|PHIL 208|Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy|4|\n|PHIL 209|17th and 18th Century Western Philosophy|4|\n|PHIL 305|Cross-cultural Philosophy|4|\n\n# Philosophy, Politics, and Economics\n\n|ETHLDR 108|Democracy and Inclusion: Hopes, Prospects, Dilemmas|2|\n|---|---|---|\n|POLSCI 204|The U.S. Constitution and its Critics|4|\n|POLSCI 311/SOCIOL 311|The Political and Social Thought of Hannah Arendt|4|\n|POLSCI 312|Islamic Political Thought|4|\n|POLSCI 313/PSYCH 313|Political Psychology|4|\n|CULANTH 314/POLSCI314|Refugees and The Biopolitics of Citizenship|4|\n\n# Metaphysics & Epistemology\n\n|PHIL 112|Thinking and Doing|2|\n|---|---|---|\n|PHIL 302|Philosophy of Language|4|\n|PHIL 301|Philosophy of Mind|4|\n|PHIL 304|Philosophy of Science|4\n\nurl: no url\n\n# MEDIART 215 Documenting City Life (2 credits)\n\nThis course combines the disciplinary practices of history, ethnography, media studies, and literature to explore life in the modern city. Through a combination of writing, photography, and film-making, students will explore and document modern city life. Students will study the techniques of writers, photographers, poets, and filmmakers from different eras and cities such as Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, London, Berlin, Hong Kong, Taipei, and New York. They will then practice the methods they have learned, creating a portfolio that includes writing, video-making, and photography to document and analyze changes over time in the life of a big city of their choice in China.\n\n# MEDIART 219/LIT 219 Translation for Kunqu: Martial Repertoire (2 credits)\n\nThis course develops skills in translation from Chinese to English in the context of Kunqu theatre. Students study the conventions of Chinese formalized stage speech while increasing their command of both formal and oral English expression. They will learn strategies to express complex cultural references with brevity and without the luxury of footnotes. The course includes an experiential learning where students will have the opportunity to work on subtitles that will be used by the Kunshan Contemporary Kunqu Theatre. Students will attend rehearsals and work with actors to reconcile their translations to the stage tradition.\n\n# MEDIART 220/CULANTH 220 Visual Anthropology (4 credits)\n\nStudents will examine, contextualize and capture the human experience in ways that communicate deeper connections to the environment that surrounds them. We will explore audiovisual material in dialogue with selected theoretical, ethnographic, and case study readings in urban studies. These time-based works provide a powerful model for training students observational skills and conceptualizing scales of analysis. Students will gain basic skills of analyzing and producing visual ethnography to enhance their understanding of the intricate relationship between visuality and politics, and then extend into reflections over the crucial ethical questions about the author’s authority as well as reciprocity with the subjects.\n\n# MEDIART 221 Introduction to Composition (4 credits)\n\nParticipants in this course will practice the rewarding and fun activity of music composition. The course will introduce a wide array of music composition techniques. Students will also explore expressive possibilities of some of the more relevant instruments in use today, namely flute, piano, and violin. The unique expressive characteristics of each instrument will serve as inspiration for short pieces the students will write. Guest artists will visit the class biweekly to perform students’ short compositions. The course also aims to expand the scope of the participants' interest in music."
